In your github repository, add a file called process.md. This is your process book. The first section in the process book is your proposal document. The proposal document should address the following points. Use these points as headers in your document.

Basic Info. The project title, your names, e-mail addresses, UIDs, a link to the project repository.

Background and Motivation. Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision.

Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits.

Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.

Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data processing be implemented?

Visualization Design. How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design. Develop three alternative prototype designs for your visualization. Create one final design that incorporates the best of your three designs. Describe your designs and justify your choices of visual encodings. We recommend you use the Five Design Sheet Methodology (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Must-Have Features. List the features without which you would consider your project to be a failure.

Optional Features. List the features which you consider to be nice to have, but not critical.

Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.

As a ballpark number, your proposal should contain about 3-4 pages of text plus 5-6 pages of sketches. Your sketches can be made by computer, but it will probably be easier to brainstorm with your team members using pen and paper and then taking a picture and uploading it to your proposal.

As a reminder, your proposal will be placed in process.md, which should be in the main directory of your git project. Create a release of your project in github with the tag "v0.1" and Release title "Proposal".

Evaluation
Submit using the text entry tool an evaluation of your team. Use the following as a template. Assuming that your name is Gracie Allen:
=================================
Group: Awesome Actor Aficionados

Jack Black (2) - Contributed pretty well, but didn't follow through on creating the git repository. Is fairly helpful in group meetings.
Ginger Rogers (5) - Ended up creating the git repository and drafting most of the proposal text.
Gracie Allen (3) - Did a good job on a couple of the sketches, but is really quiet in group meetings and doesn't contribute much.

What score the others would give me: 4
=================================

Note a few things: you assign each person a score. You get 10 points to assign to each person. If there are two people in your group, you could give each 5 points, or you could give one 2 points and the other 8 points. Be sure to include points for yourself! Note also that you should write a very short justification for each score.

The last thing in the evaluation is what score you think others will give to you. This requires some thought about how the others in the group perceive your work.
